### Process for this Check-In:

1. Open [this zip file file](files/coding-check-in-2.zip) which contains the text and an image for a recipe.
2. Paste the text into an HTML document. Save it.
3. Mark up the text with some of the elements we've learned so far. At a minimum you should include headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links.
4. Your document should validate.
5. Your work should be synced to GitHub by the start of class on Thursday, September 18. If you need to use a lab computer to sync, we will have time for that at beginning of class.

I would encourage you to work through this as you revisit the readings from *Learning Web Design*; markup makes more sense when applied to a specific task.
