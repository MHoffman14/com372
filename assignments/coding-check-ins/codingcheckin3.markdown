Process for this Check-In:

1. Create an HTML file (index.html)
2. Find four images from the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) (make a note of where each image came from & who shared it). These images should be at least 500px by 500px. Create a small thumbnail version of each image (each thumbnail should be no larger than 256px by 256 px).
3. Using the <strong>img</strong> tag, display the thumbnail images in your index.html file.
4. Create at least four additional HTML pages (one for each image, so: 1.html, 2.html, etc). Each additional HTML page should include (at minimum) a heading, credits for, and a full-size version of each image.
5. Go back to index.html and link thumbnail image 1 to HTML page 1. Repeat for each additional image.
